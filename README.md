# ORCID Public API Clients
Clients using the ORCID public API

This is a repository of scripts that act as clients to the ORCID Public API.

If you just want one of the clients (i.e. a sub-directory of the repository), see [Using Git Sparse Checkout](https://itwiki.wrlc.org/index.php/Using_Git_Sparse_Checkout) (internal WRLC only).
